        <p> Conventional wisdom says eye-catching visuals and snappy videos are key to capturing attention in social feeds. But James J. Choi, a professor of finance at Yale School of Management, turned this notion on its head. His <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/james-j-choi-finance_personal-finance-syllabus-activity-7018572365764710401-a37g/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a> featuring nothing more than a text-only PDF went viral, meaning we should all take notes on what it takes to stand out in crowded feeds.</p>

        <h2>The Unlikely Viral Sensation</h2>
        <p>Professor Choi took an unconventional approach by sharing the syllabus of his personal finance course at Yale. At first glance, a course syllabus seems like an unlikely candidate for viral content. But the results tell a different story—this simple document sparked widespread interest and engagement across LinkedIn.</p>

        <h2>Breaking the Rules of Engagement</h2>
        <p>The success of Professor Choi’s post flies in the face of traditional social media guidance, which often emphasizes the importance of visual content. So, what made this text-only PDF so compelling? Let’s break it down:

<ol>
<li><strong>Fresh Perspective:</strong> In his post, Professor Choi didn't just share a syllabus; he outlined why his course is different from most personal finance courses. He articulated his ambitions for revolutionizing how personal finance is taught, offering a fresh perspective that intrigued many professionals.</li>
<li><strong>Unprecedented Access:</strong> By sharing his course syllabus, Professor Choi provided a glimpse into the halls of Yale to people who wouldn't normally have access to such information. This 'behind-the-scenes' look at an Ivy League curriculum piqued the curiosity of many LinkedIn users.</li>
<li><strong>Standout Format:</strong> In a feed dominated by flashy images and auto-playing videos, the in-depth document stood out precisely because it was different. The text-only PDF signaled deeper, more substantial content, attracting those hungry for comprehensive knowledge rather than quick soundbites.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Lessons for Thought Leaders</h2>
<ol>
<li>Don't underestimate the power of unique, in-depth content.</li>
<li>Provide exclusive or typically inaccessible information to drive engagement.</li>
<li>Sometimes, buck the trend (like using text-only content) to stand out.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bonus Lesson</h2>
<p>Follow up on successful posts with related, valuable content to maintain momentum. Professor Choi did this by sharing slides from his presentation titled 'Personal Finance Mistakes You're Probably Making'. This became one of his top performing posts of all time.</p>
