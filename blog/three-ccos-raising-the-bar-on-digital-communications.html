        <p>Three innovative CCOs are redefining digital engagement on LinkedIn. Learn how they support their organizations with a voice of their own.</p>

        <h2>Nestlé's Lisa Gibby</h2>
        <p>Nestlé's Lisa Gibby is a master of going beyond the polished press release. Rather than simply sharing glossy announcements, she takes her LinkedIn followers on the journey, giving them a behind-the-scenes look at the thinking and process behind Nestlé's communications. In doing so, she not only provides valuable insights but also shines a spotlight on the talented team of communicators who support her.</p>

        <p>Lisa's approach is a refreshing departure from the typical corporate social media feed. Her content feels genuine and human, fostering a sense of connection with her audience. By inviting followers into the inner workings of Nestlé's communications, she builds trust and demonstrates the company's commitment to transparency.</p>

        <h2>Microsoft's Frank X. Shaw</h2>
        <p>As the pace of AI innovation accelerates, Microsoft's Frank X. Shaw has emerged as a trusted guide, helping his LinkedIn audience navigate the breakneck speed of updates from the tech giant. Rather than simply broadcasting the latest news, Frank presents himself as an approachable, relatable communicator.</p>

        <p>Frank's approach harkens back to the sense of community often seen on platforms like Reddit, where he regularly engages with comments and even defends Microsoft from detractors. This personal touch humanizes the company and positions Frank as a thought leader who is eager to engage in substantive discussions.</p>

        <h2>Hasbro's Roberta Thomson</h2>
        <p>Hasbro's Roberta Thomson has mastered the art of shedding light across the company's diverse portfolio of beloved brands, all while maintaining an authentic, true-to-self presence on LinkedIn. Her content seamlessly weaves between highlighting product launches, celebrating employee achievements, and sharing insights into the broader toy and gaming industry.</p>

        <p>While Roberta could improve on some mechanics, such as avoiding linking out to PDFs hosted on Hasbro's corporate site, she has laid a strong foundation for effective digital communications. Her ability to connect with her audience and tell Hasbro's story in a genuine, relatable way sets her apart as a rising star in the world of corporate communications.</p>

        <h2>The New Era of Digital-First CCOs</h2>
        <p>The three CCOs highlighted in this post exemplify the evolving role of corporate communications leaders in the digital age. By embracing authenticity, transparency, and a willingness to engage with their audiences, they are setting a new standard for effective, impactful digital communications.</p>

        <p>As the social media landscape continues to shift, these trailblazers serve as inspiring models for CCOs and communications professionals who seek to build genuine connections, foster trust, and amplify their brand's message in the digital space.</p>
